       "[Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nAI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called Machine Intelligence. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment and loss of funding. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI spring of the 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field\\'s long-term goals.To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and other fields.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning, problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other peo', metadata={'title': 'Artificial intelligence', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='An artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical type of intelligent agent. If realized, an AGI could learn to accomplish any intellectual task that human beings or animals can perform. Alternatively, AGI has been defined as an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically valuable tasks. Creating AGI is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and of companies such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.\\nThe timeline for AGI development remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. Some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might take a century or longer; and a minority believe it may never be achieved. There is debate on the exact definition of AGI, and regarding whether modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are early yet incomplete forms of AGI.Contention exists over the potential for AGI to pose a threat to humanity; for example, OpenAI treats it as an existential risk, while others find the development of AGI to be too remote to present a risk.A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI R&D projects spread across 37 countries.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nAGI is also known as strong AI, full AI, human-level AI or general intelligent action. However, some academic sources reserve the term \"strong AI\" for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness. In contrast, weak AI (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem, but lacks general cognitive abilities. Some academic sources use \"weak AI\" to refer more broadly to any programs that neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.Related concepts include artificial superintelligence and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans. And the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, for example similar to the agricultural revolution.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\nVarious criteria for intelligence have been proposed (most famously the Turing test) but no definition is broadly accepted.\\n\\n\\n=== Intelligence traits ===\\nHowever, researchers generally hold that intelligence is required to do all of the following:\\nreason, use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under uncertainty\\nrepresent knowledge, including common sense knowledge\\nplan\\nlearn\\ncommunicate in natural language\\nif necessary, integrate these skills in completion of any given goalMany interdisciplinary approaches (e.g. cognitive science, computational intelligence, and decision making) consider additional traits such as imagination (the ability to form novel mental images and concepts) and autonomy.Computer-based systems that exhibit many of these capabilities exist (e.g. see computational creativity, automated reasoning, decision support system, robot, evolutionary computation, intelligent agent). However, no consensus holds that modern AI systems possess them to an adequate degree.\\n\\n\\n=== Physical traits ===\\nOther capabilities are considered desirable in intelligent systems, as they may affect intelligence or aid in its expression. These include:\\nthe ability to sense (e.g. see, hear, etc.), and\\nthe ability to act (e.g. move and manipulate objects, change location to explore, etc.)This includes the ability to detect and respond to hazard.\\n\\n\\n=== Tests for human-level AGI ===\\nSeveral tests meant to confirm human-level AGI have been considered, including:\\nThe Turing Test (Turing)\\nA machine and a human both converse unseen with a second human, who must evaluate which of the two is the machine, which passes the test if it can fool the evaluator a significant fraction of the time. Note: Turing does not prescribe what should qualify as intelligence, only that knowing that it is a machine should disqualify it. The AI Eugene Goostman achieved Turing\\'s estimate of convincing 30% of ju', metadata={'title': 'Artificial general intelligence', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GAI, or GenAI) is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other media, using generative models. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data that has similar characteristics.In the early 2020s, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input. These include large language model (LLM) chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard, and LLaMA, and text-to-image artificial intelligence art systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.Generative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including art, writing, script writing, software development, product design, healthcare, finance, gaming, marketing, and fashion. Investment in generative AI surged during the early 2020s, with large companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms developing generative AI models. However, there are also concerns about the potential misuse of generative AI, including cybercrime, the creation fake news, or the production of deepfakes that can be used to deceive or manipulate people.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Since its inception, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automatons has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet\\'s automaton created in the early 1800s.Artificial Intelligence is an idea that has been captivating society since the mid-20th century. It began with science fiction familiarizing the world with the concept but the idea wasn\\'t fully seen in the scientific manner until Alan Turing, a polymath, was curious about the feasibility of the concept. Turing\\'s groundbreaking 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" posed fundamental questions about machine reasoning similar to human intelligence, significantly contributing to the conceptual groundwork of AI. The development of AI was not very rapid at first because of the high costs and the fact that computers were not able to store commands. This changed during the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI where there was an inspiring call for AI research which led it to be a landmark event as it set the precedent for two decades of rapid advancements in the field.Since the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.The field of machine learning often uses statistical models, including generative models, to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the emergence of deep learning drove progress and research in image classification, speech reco', metadata={'title': 'Generative artificial intelligence', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A.I. Artificial Intelligence (or simply A.I.) is a 2001 American science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by Ian Watson were loosely based on the 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" by Brian Aldiss. Set in a futuristic society, the film stars Haley Joel Osment as David, a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love. Jude Law, Frances O\\'Connor, Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt star in supporting roles.\\nDevelopment of A.I. originally began after producer/director Stanley Kubrick acquired the rights to Aldiss\\' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson and Sara Maitland, until the mid-1990s. The film languished in development hell for years, partly because Kubrick felt that computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick died in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson\\'s treatment for the screenplay, and dedicated the film to Kubrick.\\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence was released on June 29, 2001, by Warner Bros. Pictures in North America. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $235.9 million against a budget of $90–100 million. It was also nominated for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score (for John Williams) at the 74th Academy Awards. In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics around the world, A.I. Artificial Intelligence was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000. It has since been called one of Spielberg\\'s best works and one of the greatest films of the 2000s, the 21st century, and of all time.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nIn the 22nd century, rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out 99% of existing cities, reducing the world\\'s population. Mecha humanoid robots, seemingly capable of complex thought but lacking emotions, have been created as replacements. In Madison, New Jersey, David, a prototype Mecha child capable of experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin contracted a rare disease and has been placed in suspended animation. Initially uncomfortable with David, Monica eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol. Seeking to have her love him in return, he also befriends Teddy, Martin\\'s old robotic teddy bear. After Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home, he jealously goads David into cutting off a piece of Monica\\'s hair. That night, David enters his adoptive parents\\' room and cuts a lock of hair from Monica\\'s head using a pair of scissors. Monica turns over and is poked in the eye by the scissors. As Henry helps her treat her eye, Teddy picks up the lock of hair from the floor and places it in his pocket. At a pool party, one of Martin\\'s friends pokes David with a knife, triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs onto Martin, and they both fall into the pool and sink to the bottom. Martin is rescued before he drowns, and David is accused of endangering living people. Henry convinces Monica to return David to his creators for destruction, believing that if David is capable of love, then he is also capable of hate. En route, Monica instead spares David by abandoning him in the woods, which is full of scrap metal and obsolete Mecha. Now accompanied solely by Teddy, David recalls The Adventures of Pinocchio and decides to find the Blue Fairy in order to become human, which he believes will regain Monica\\'s love.\\nDavid and Teddy are captured by the \"Flesh Fair\", a traveling circus-like event where obsolete Mecha are destroyed before jeering crowds. About to be destroyed himself, David pleads for his life, and the audience, deceived by David\\'s realistic nature, revolts and allows David to escape alongside Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha on the run from authorities after being fr', metadata={'title': 'A.I.

       " Document(page_content=\"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. AI, like electricity or computers, is a general-purpose technology that has a multitude of applications. It has been used in fields of language translation, image recognition, credit scoring, e-commerce and other domains.\\n\\n\\n== Internet and e-commerce ==\\n\\n\\n=== Recommendation systems ===\\n\\nA recommendation system predicts the rating or preference a user would give to an item. Artificial intelligence recommendation systems are designed to offer suggestions based on previous behavior. These systems have been used by companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube, where they generate personalized playlists, product suggestions, and video recommendations.\\n\\n\\n=== Web feeds and posts ===\\nMachine learning is also used in web feeds such as for determining which posts should show up in social media feeds. Various types of social media analysis also make use of machine learning and there is research into its use for (semi-)automated tagging/enhancement/correction of online misinformation and related filter bubbles.\\n\\n\\n=== Targeted advertising and increasing internet engagement ===\\n\\nAI is used to target web advertisements to those most likely to click or engage in them. It is also used to increase time spent on a website by selecting attractive content for the viewer. It can predict or generalize the behavior of customers from their digital footprints. Both AdSense and Facebook use AI for advertising.\\nOnline gambling companies use AI to improve customer targeting.Personality computing AI models add psychological targeting to more traditional social demographics or behavioral targeting. AI has been used to customize shopping options and personalize offers.\\n\\n\\n=== Virtual assistants ===\\n\\nIntelligent personal assistants use AI to understand many natural language requests in other ways than rudimentary commands. Common examples are Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and a more recent AI, ChatGPT by OpenAI.\\n\\n\\n=== Search engines ===\\nSearch engines that use artificial intelligence include Google Search and Bing Chat.\\n\\n\\n=== Spam filtering ===\\n\\nMachine learning can be used to fight against spam, scams, and phishing. It can scrutinize the contents of spam and phishing attacks to identify any malicious elements. Numerous models built on machine learning algorithms exhibit exceptional performance with accuracies over 90% in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.\\n\\n\\n=== Language translation ===\\n\\nAI has been used to automatically translate spoken language and textual content, in products such as Microsoft Translator, Google Translate and DeepL Translator. Additionally, research and development are in progress to decode and conduct animal communication.\\n\\n\\n=== Facial recognition and image labeling ===\\n\\nAI has been used in facial recognition systems, with a 99% accuracy rate. Some examples are Apple's Face ID and Android's Face Unlock, which are used to secure mobile devices.Image labeling has been used by Google to detect products in photos and to allow people to search based on a photo. Image labeling has also been demonstrated to generate speech to describe images to blind people.  Facebook's DeepFace identifies human faces in digital images.\\n\\n\\n== Games ==\\n\\nGames have been a major application of AI's capabilities since the 1950s. In the 21st century, AIs have produced superhuman results in many games, including chess (Deep Blue), Jeopardy! (Watson), Go (AlphaGo), poker (Pluribus and Cepheus), E-sports (StarCraft), and general game playing (AlphaZero and MuZero). AI has replaced hand-coded algorithms in most chess programs.

       " Document(page_content='The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.\\nAlan Turing was the first person to carry out substantial research in the field that he called Machine Intelligence. The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, USA during the summer of 1956. Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.Eventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. In 1974, in response to the criticism from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence, and the difficult years that followed would later be known as an \"AI winter\". Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 1980s the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again.\\nInvestment and interest in AI boomed in the 2020s when machine learning was successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to new methods, the application of powerful computer hardware, and the collection of immense data sets.\\n\\n\\n== Precursors ==\\n\\n\\n=== Mythical, fictional, and speculative precursors ===\\n\\n\\n==== Myth and legend ====\\nIn Greek mythology, Talos was a giant constructed of bronze who acted as guardian for the island of Crete. He would throw boulders at the ships of invaders and would complete 3 circuits around the island\\'s perimeter daily. According to pseudo-Apollodorus\\' Bibliotheke, Hephaestus forged Talos with the aid of a cyclops and presented the automaton as a gift to Minos. In the Argonautica, Jason and the Argonauts defeated him by way of a single plug near his foot which, once removed, allowed the vital ichor to flow out from his body and left him inanimate.Pygmalion was a legendary king and sculptor of Greek mythology, famously represented in Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses. In the 10th book of Ovid\\'s narrative poem, Pygmalion becomes disgusted with women when he witnesses the way in which the Propoetides prostitute themselves. Despite this, he makes offerings at the temple of Venus asking the goddess to bring to him a woman just like a statue he carved.\\n\\n\\n==== Medieval legends of artificial beings ====\\nIn Of the Nature of Things, written by the Swiss alchemist, Paracelsus, he describes a procedure that he claims can fabricate an \"artificial man\". By placing the \"sperm of a man\" in horse dung, and feeding it the \"Arcanum of Mans blood\" after 40 days, the concoction will become a living infant.The earliest written account regarding golem-making is found in the writings of Eleazar ben Judah of Worms in the early 13th century. During the Middle Ages, it was believed that the animation of a Golem could be achieved by insertion of a piece of paper with any of God’s names on it, into the mouth of the clay figure. Unlike legendary automata like Brazen Heads, a Golem was unable to speak.Takwin, the artificial creation of life, was a frequent topic of Ismaili alchemical manuscripts, especially those attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan.

       " Document(page_content='In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a hallucination or artificial hallucination (also called confabulation or delusion) is a response generated by an AI which contains false or misleading information presented as fact.For example, a hallucinating chatbot might, when asked to generate a financial report for a company, falsely state that the company\\'s revenue was $13.6 billion (or some other number apparently \"plucked from thin air\").\\nSuch phenomena are termed \"hallucinations\", in loose analogy with the phenomenon of hallucination in human psychology. However, one key difference is that human hallucination is usually associated with false percepts, but an AI hallucination is associated with the category of unjustified responses or beliefs. Some researchers believe the specific term \"AI hallucination\" unreasonably anthropomorphizes computers.AI hallucination gained prominence during the AI spring, alongside the rollout of widely used chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Users complained that such chatbots often seemed to pointlessly embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within their generated content. By 2023, analysts considered frequent hallucination to be a major problem in LLM technology, with some estimating chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time and a study finding factual errors in 46% of generated responses.\\n\\n\\n== Analysis ==\\nVarious researchers cited by Wired have classified adversarial hallucinations as a high-dimensional statistical phenomenon, or have attributed hallucinations to insufficient training data. Some researchers believe that some \"incorrect\" AI responses classified by humans as \"hallucinations\" in the case of object detection may in fact be justified by the training data, or even that an AI may be giving the \"correct\" answer that the human reviewers are failing to see. \\nFor example, an adversarial image that looks, to a human, like an ordinary image of a dog, may in fact be seen by the AI to contain tiny patterns that (in authentic images) would only appear when viewing a cat. The AI is detecting real-world visual patterns that humans are insensitive to. However, these findings have been challenged by other researchers. For example, it was objected that the models can be biased towards superficial statistics, leading adversarial training to not be robust in real-world scenarios.\\n\\n\\n== In natural language processing ==\\nIn natural language processing, a hallucination is often defined as \"generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the provided source content\". Depending on whether the output contradicts the prompt or not they could be divided to closed-domain and open-domain respectively.Hallucination was shown to be a statistically inevitable byproduct of any imperfect generative model that is trained to maximize training likelihood, such as GPT-3, and requires active learning (such as Reinforcement learning from human feedback) to be avoided. Other research takes an anthropomorphic perspective and posits hallucinations as arising from a tension between novelty and usefulness. For instance, Teresa Amabile and Pratt define human creativity as the production of novel and useful ideas. By extension, a focus on novelty in machine creativity can lead to production of original but inaccurate responses, i.e. falsehoods, whereas a focus on usefulness can result in ineffectual rote memorized responses.Errors in encoding and decoding between text and representations can cause hallucinations. AI training to produce diverse responses can also lead to hallucination. Hallucinations can also occur when the AI is trained on a dataset wherein labeled summaries, despite being factually accurate, are not directly grounded in the labeled data purportedly being \"summarized\". Larger datasets can create a problem of parametric knowledge (knowledge that is hard-wired in learned system parameters), creating hallucinations if the system is overconfident in its hardwired kn', metadata={'title': 'Hallucination (artificial intelligence)', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence art is any visual artwork created through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) programs.Artists began to create AI art in the mid to late-20th century, when the discipline was founded. In the early 21st century, the availability of AI art tools to the general public increased, providing opportunities for use outside of academia and professional artists. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns, including those related to copyright, deception, and its impact on traditional artists, including their incomes. \\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\nThe concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music.  The tradition of creative automatons has flourished throughout history, such as Maillardet\\'s automaton, created in the early 1800s.The academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Since its founding, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.\\n\\n\\n=== 1950s to 2000s ===\\nSince the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. These works were sometimes referred to as algorithmic art, computer art, digital art or new media.One of the first significant AI art systems is AARON, developed by Harold Cohen beginning in the late 1960s at the University of California at San Diego. AARON is the most notable example of AI art in the era of GOFAI programming because of its use of a symbolic rule-based approach to generate technical images. Cohen developed AARON with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. In its primitive form, AARON created simple black and white drawings. Cohen would later finish the drawings by painting them. Throughout the years, he also began to develop a way for AARON to also paint. Cohen designed AARON to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen. AARON was exhibited in 1972 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.In both 1991 and 1992, Karl Sims won the Golden Nica award at Prix Ars Electronica for his 3D AI animated videos using artificial evolution.In 2001 Scott Draves won the Fundacion Telefonica Life 4.0 prize for Electric Sheep, which used AI to create an infinite animation by learning from its audience.\\nIn 2009, Eric Millikin won the Pulitzer Prize along with several other awards for his artificial intelligence art that was critical of government corruption in Detroit and resulted in the city\\'s mayor being sent to jail.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s and deep learning ===\\nIn 2014, Ian Goodfellow and colleagues at Université de Montréal developed the generative adversarial network (GAN), a type of deep neural network capable of learning to mimic the statistical distribution of input data such as images. The GAN uses a \"generator\" to create new images and a \"discriminator\" to decide which created images are considered successful. Unlike previous algorithmic art which followed hand-coded rules, generative adversarial networks could learn a specific aesthetic by analyzing a dataset of example images.In 2015, a team at Google released DeepDream, a program that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia. The process creates deliberately over-processed images with a dream-like appearance reminiscent of a psychedelic experience.In 2018, an auction sale of artificial intelligence art was he', metadata={'title': 'Artificial intelligence art', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_art'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally, including in the European Union (which has governmental regulatory power) and in supra-national bodies like the IEEE, OECD (which do not) and others. Since 2016, a wave of AI ethics guidelines have been published in order to maintain social control over the technology. Regulation is considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks. In addition to regulation, AI-deploying organizations need to play a central role in creating and deploying trustworthy AI in line with the principles of trustworthy AI, and take accountability to mitigate the risks. Regulation of AI through mechanisms such as review boards can also be seen as social means to approach the AI control problem.According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nExperts and advocates in responsible AI, AI ethics, consumer protection, and cybersecurity have vocalized the need for guardrails around AI development since at least the 1960s. In 2017, Elon Musk called for regulation of AI development. According to NPR, the Tesla CEO was \"clearly not thrilled\" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believed the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: \"Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there\\'s a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilization.\" In response, some politicians expressed skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that is still in development. Responding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has argued that AI is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology. Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself, some scholars suggested developing common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty.In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".\\n\\n\\n== Perspectives ==\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligences is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI. Regulation is now generally considered necessary to both encourage AI and manage associated risks. Public administration and policy considerations generally focus on the technical and economic implications and on trustworthy and human-centered AI systems, although regulation of artificial superintelligences is also considered. The basic approach to regulation focuses on the risks and biases of machine-learning algorithms, at the level of the input data, algorithm testing, and decision model. It also focuses on the explainability of the outputs.There have been both hard law and soft law proposals to regulate AI. Some legal scholars have noted that hard law approaches to AI regulation have substantial challenges.

       " Document(page_content='The ethics of artificial intelligence is the branch of the ethics of technology specific to artificially intelligent systems. It is sometimes divided into a concern with the moral behavior of humans as they design, make, use and treat artificially intelligent systems, and a concern with the behavior of machines, in machine ethics.\\n\\n\\n== Approaches ==\\n\\n\\n=== Machine ethics ===\\n\\nMachine ethics (or machine morality) is the field of research concerned with designing Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs), robots or artificially intelligent computers that behave morally or as though moral. To account for the nature of these agents, it has been suggested to consider certain philosophical ideas, like the standard characterizations of agency, rational agency, moral agency, and artificial agency, which are related to the concept of AMAs.Isaac Asimov considered the issue in the 1950s in his I, Robot. At the insistence of his editor John W. Campbell Jr., he proposed the Three Laws of Robotics to govern artificially intelligent systems. Much of his work was then spent testing the boundaries of his three laws to see where they would break down, or where they would create paradoxical or unanticipated behavior. His work suggests that no set of fixed laws can sufficiently anticipate all possible circumstances. More recently, academics and many governments have challenged the idea that AI can itself be held accountable. A panel convened by the United Kingdom in 2010 revised Asimov\\'s laws to clarify that AI is the responsibility either of its manufacturers, or of its owner/operator.In 2009, during an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale of Lausanne, Switzerland, robots that were programmed to cooperate with each other (in searching out a beneficial resource and avoiding a poisonous one) eventually learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource.Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions. The President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence has commissioned a study to look at this issue. They point to programs like the Language Acquisition Device which can emulate human interaction.\\nVernor Vinge has suggested that a moment may come when some computers are smarter than humans. He calls this \"the Singularity\".  He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans. This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism. The Machine Intelligence Research Institute has suggested a need to build \"Friendly AI\", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.There are discussions on creating tests to see if an AI is capable of making ethical decisions. Alan Winfield concludes that the Turing test is flawed and the requirement for an AI to pass the test is too low. A proposed alternative test is one called the Ethical Turing Test, which would improve on the current test by having multiple judges decide if the AI\\'s decision is ethical or unethical.In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference organized by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers, and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including bein', metadata={'title': 'Ethics of artificial intelligence', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Explainable AI (XAI), often overlapping with Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), either refers to an AI system over which it is possible for humans to retain intellectual oversight, or to the methods to achieve this. The main focus is usually on the reasoning behind the decisions or predictions made by the AI which are made more understandable and transparent. XAI counters the \"black box\" tendency of machine learning, where even the AI\\'s designers cannot explain why it arrived at a specific decision.XAI hopes to help users of AI-powered systems perform more effectively by improving their understanding of how those systems reason. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Even if there is no such legal right or regulatory requirement, XAI can improve the user experience of a product or service by helping end users trust that the AI is making good decisions. XAI aims to explain what has been done, what is being done, and what will be done next, and to unveil which information these actions are based on. This makes it possible to confirm existing knowledge, challenge existing knowledge, and generate new assumptions.Machine learning (ML) algorithms used in AI can be categorized as white-box or black-box. White-box models provide results that are understandable to experts in the domain. Black-box models, on the other hand, are extremely hard to explain and can hardly be understood even by domain experts. XAI algorithms follow the three principles of transparency, interpretability, and explainability. A model is transparent “if the processes that extract model parameters from training data and generate labels from testing data can be described and motivated by the approach designer.” Interpretability describes the possibility of comprehending the ML model and presenting the underlying basis for decision-making in a way that is understandable to humans. Explainability is a concept that is recognized as important, but a consensus definition is not available. One possibility is “the collection of features of the interpretable domain that have contributed, for a given example, to producing a decision (e.g., classification or regression)”. If algorithms fulfill these principles, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking them and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts.Sometimes it is also possible to achieve a high-accuracy result with white-box ML algorithms. These algorithms have an interpretable structure that can be used to explain predictions. Concept Bottleneck Models, which use concept-level abstractions to explain model reasoning, are examples of this and can be applied in both image and text prediction tasks. This is especially important in domains like medicine, defense, finance, and law, where it is crucial to understand decisions and build trust in the algorithms. Many researchers argue that, at least for supervised machine learning, the way forward is symbolic regression, where the algorithm searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset.AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command \"maximize the accuracy of assessing how positive film reviews are in the test dataset.\" The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as \"reviews containing the word \"horrible\" are likely to be negative.\" However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as \"reviews containing \\'Daniel Day-Lewis\\' are usually positive\"; such rules may be undesirable if they are likely to fail to generalize outside the training set, or if people consider the rule to be \"cheating\" or \"unfair.\" A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea of how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test set.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nCooperation between agents – in this case, algorithms and humans – depends on trust.', metadata={'title': 'Explainable artificial intelligence', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Friendly artificial intelligence (also friendly AI or FAI) is hypothetical artificial general intelligence (AGI) that would have a positive (benign) effect on humanity or at least align with human interests or contribute to fostering the improvement of the human species. It is a part of the ethics of artificial intelligence and is closely related to machine ethics. While machine ethics is concerned with how an artificially intelligent agent should behave, friendly artificial intelligence research is focused on how to practically bring about this behavior and ensuring it is adequately constrained.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and usage ==\\nThe term was coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is best known for popularizing the idea, to discuss superintelligent artificial agents that reliably implement human values. Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig\\'s leading artificial intelligence textbook, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, describes the idea:\\nYudkowsky (2008) goes into more detail about how to design a Friendly AI. He asserts that friendliness (a desire not to harm humans) should be designed in from the start, but that the designers should recognize both that their own designs may be flawed, and that the robot will learn and evolve over time. Thus the challenge is one of mechanism design—to define a mechanism for evolving AI systems under a system of checks and balances, and to give the systems utility functions that will remain friendly in the face of such changes.\\n\\'Friendly\\' is used in this context as technical terminology, and picks out agents that are safe and useful, not necessarily ones that are \"friendly\" in the colloquial sense. The concept is primarily invoked in the context of discussions of recursively self-improving artificial agents that rapidly explode in intelligence, on the grounds that this hypothetical technology would have a large, rapid, and difficult-to-control impact on human society.\\n\\n\\n== Risks of unfriendly AI ==\\n\\nThe roots of concern about artificial intelligence are very old. Kevin LaGrandeur showed that the dangers specific to AI can be seen in ancient literature concerning artificial humanoid servants such as the golem, or the proto-robots of Gerbert of Aurillac and Roger Bacon.  In those stories, the extreme intelligence and power of these humanoid creations clash with their status as slaves (which by nature are seen as sub-human), and cause disastrous conflict. By 1942 these themes prompted Isaac Asimov to create the \"Three Laws of Robotics\"—principles hard-wired into all the robots in his fiction, intended to prevent them from turning on their creators, or allowing them to come to harm.In modern times as the prospect of superintelligent AI looms nearer, philosopher Nick Bostrom has said that superintelligent AI systems with goals that are not aligned with human ethics are intrinsically dangerous unless extreme measures are taken to ensure the safety of humanity.  He put it this way:\\n\\nBasically we should assume that a \\'superintelligence\\' would be able to achieve whatever goals it has. Therefore, it is extremely important that the goals we endow it with, and its entire motivation system, is \\'human friendly.\\'\\nIn 2008 Eliezer Yudkowsky called for the creation of \"friendly AI\" to mitigate existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence. He explains: \"The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.\"Steve Omohundro says that a sufficiently advanced AI system will, unless explicitly counteracted, exhibit a number of basic \"drives\", such as resource acquisition, self-preservation, and continuous self-improvement, because of the intrinsic nature of any goal-driven systems and that these drives will, \"without special precautions\", cause the AI to exhibit undesired behavior.Alexander Wissner-Gross says that AIs driven to maximize their future freedom of action (or causal path entropy) might be considered friendly if their planning horizon is long', metadata={'title': 'Friendly artificial intelligence', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Artificial intelligence in healthcare is a term used to describe the use of machine-learning algorithms and software, or artificial intelligence (AI), to copy human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and understanding of complex medical and health care data, or to exceed human capabilities by providing new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to approximate conclusions based solely on input data.\\nThe primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between clinical data and patient outcomes. AI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. What differentiates AI technology from traditional technologies in healthcare is the ability to gather larger and more diverse data, process it, and produce a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through machine learning algorithms and deep learning. Because radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy. These processes can recognize patterns in behavior and create their own logic. To gain useful insights and predictions, machine learning models must be trained using extensive amounts of input data. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: once a goal is set, the algorithm learns exclusively from the input data and can only understand what it has been programmed to do, (2) and some deep learning algorithms are black boxes; algorithms can predict with extreme precision, but offer little to no comprehensible explanation to the logic behind its decisions aside from the data and type of algorithm used.As widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and industry. Additionally, greater consideration is being given to the unprecedented ethical concerns related to its practice such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and representation biases. Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nResearch in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system, known as Dendral. While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN, considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however.The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, Bayesian networks, and artificial neural networks, have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare.\\nMedical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: \\n\\nImprovements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing\\nGrowth of genomic sequencing databases\\nWidespread implementation of electronic health record systems\\nImprovements in natural language processing and computer vision, enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes\\nEnhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery\\nIncreased tree-based machine learning models that allow flexibility in establishing health predictors\\nImprovements in deep learning techniques and data logs in rare diseasesAI algorithms can also be used', metadata={'title': 'Artificial intelligence in healthcare', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The philosophy of artificial intelligence is a branch of the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of computer science that explores artificial intelligence and its implications for knowledge and understanding of intelligence, ethics, consciousness, epistemology, and free will. Furthermore, the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people (or, at least, artificial creatures; see artificial life) so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers. These factors contributed to the emergence of the philosophy of artificial intelligence. \\nThe philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:\\nCan a machine act intelligently? Can it solve any problem that a person would solve by thinking?\\nAre human intelligence and machine intelligence the same?  Is the human brain essentially a computer?\\nCan a machine have a mind, mental states, and consciousness in the same sense that a human being can? Can it feel how things are?Questions like these reflect the divergent interests of AI researchers, cognitive scientists and philosophers respectively. The scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of \"intelligence\" and \"consciousness\" and exactly which \"machines\" are under discussion.\\nImportant propositions in the philosophy of AI include some of the following:\\n\\nTuring\\'s \"polite convention\": If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.\\nThe Dartmouth proposal: \"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\"\\nAllen Newell and Herbert A. Simon\\'s physical symbol system hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"\\nJohn Searle\\'s strong AI hypothesis: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"\\nHobbes\\' mechanism: \"For \\'reason\\' ... is nothing but \\'reckoning,\\' that is adding and subtracting, of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the \\'marking\\' and \\'signifying\\' of our thoughts...\"\\n\\n\\n== Can a machine display general intelligence? ==\\nIs it possible to create a machine that can solve all the problems humans solve using their intelligence? This question defines the scope of what machines could do in the future and guides the direction of AI research. It only concerns the behavior of machines and ignores the issues of interest to psychologists, cognitive scientists and philosophers, evoking the question: does it matter whether a machine is really thinking, as a person thinks, rather than just producing outcomes that appear to result from thinking?The basic position of most AI researchers is summed up in this statement, which appeared in the proposal for the Dartmouth workshop of 1956:\\n\\n\"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\"Arguments against the basic premise must show that building a working AI system is impossible because there is some practical limit to the abilities of computers or that there is some special quality of the human mind that is necessary for intelligent behavior and yet cannot be duplicated by a machine (or by the methods of current AI research).  Arguments in favor of the basic premise must show that such a system is possible.\\nIt is also possible to sidestep the connection between the two parts of the above proposal. For instance, machine learning, beginning with Turing\\'s infamous child machine proposal, essentially achieves the desired feature of intelligence without a precise design-time description as to how it would exactly work. The account on robot tacit knowledge eliminates the need for a precise description altogether.\\nThe first step to answering the question is to clearly define \"intellige', metadata={'title': 'Philosophy of artificial intelligence', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a European Union regulation on artificial intelligence in the European Union. Proposed by the European Commission on 21 April 2021 and not yet enforced, it aims to introduce a common regulatory and legal framework for artificial intelligence.Its scope encompasses all types of artificial intelligence in a broad range of sectors (exceptions include AI systems used solely for military, national security, research, and non-professional purpose). As a piece of product regulation, it would not confer rights on individuals, but would regulate the providers of artificial intelligence systems, and entities making use of them in a professional capacity.The AI Act was revised following the rise in popularity of generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, whose general-purpose capabilities present different stakes and did not fit the defined framework. More restrictive regulations are planned for powerful generative AI systems with systemic impact.The proposed EU Artificial Intelligence Act aims to classify and regulate artificial intelligence applications based on their risk to cause harm. This classification includes four categories of risk (\"unacceptable\", \"high\", \"limited\" and \"minimal\"), plus one additional category for general-purpose AI. Applications deemed to represent unacceptable risks are banned. High-risk ones must comply to security, transparency and quality obligations and undergo conformity assessments. Limited-risk AI applications only have transparency obligations, and those representing minimal risks are not regulated. For general-purpose AI, transparency requirements are imposed, with additional and thorough evaluations when representing particularly high risks.The Act further proposes the introduction of a European Artificial Intelligence Board to promote national cooperation and ensure compliance with the regulation.The AI Act is expected to have a large impact on the economy. Like the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation, it can apply extraterritorially to providers from outside the EU, if they have products within the EU.\\n\\n\\n== Risk categories ==\\nThere are different risk categories depending on the type of application, and one specifically dedicated to general-purpose generative AI :\\n\\nUnacceptable risk : AI applications that fall under this category are banned. This includes AI applications that manipulate human behaviour, those that use real-time remote biometric identification (including facial recognition) in public spaces, and those used for social scoring (ranking people based on their personal characteristics, socio-economic status or behaviour).\\nHigh-risk : the AI applications that pose significant threats to health, safety, or the fundamental rights of persons. Notably, AI systems used in health, education, recruitment, critical infrastructure management, law enforcement or justice. They are subject to obligations of quality, transparency, human supervision and security. They must be evaluated before they are placed on the market, as well as during their life cycle. The list of high-risk applications can be expanded without requiring to modify the AI Act itself.\\nGeneral-purpose AI (\"GPAI\") : this category was added in 2023, and includes in particular foundation models like ChatGPT. They are subject to transparency requirements. High-impact general-purpose AI systems which could pose systemic risks (notably those trained using a computation capability of more than 1025 FLOPS) must also undergo a thorough evaluation process.\\nLimited risk : these systems are subject to transparency obligations aimed at informing users that they are interacting with an artificial intelligence system and allowing them to exercise their choices.

Since then, many science fiction stories have presented different effects of creating such intelligence, often involving rebellions by robots. Among the best known of these are Stanley Kubrick\\'s 1968 2001: A Space Odyssey with its murderous onboard computer HAL 9000, contrasting with the more benign R2-D2 in George Lucas\\'s 1977 Star Wars and the eponymous robot in Pixar\\'s 2008 WALL-E.\\nScientists and engineers have noted the implausibility of many science fiction scenarios, but have mentioned fictional robots many times in artificial intelligence research articles, most often in a utopian context.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nThe notion of advanced robots with human-like intelligence dates back at least to Samuel Butler\\'s 1872 novel Erewhon. This drew on an earlier (1863) article of his, Darwin among the Machines, where he raised the question of the evolution of consciousness among self-replicating machines that might supplant humans as the dominant species. Similar ideas were also discussed by others around the same time as Butler, including George Eliot in a chapter of her final published work Impressions of Theophrastus Such (1879). The creature in Mary Shelley\\'s 1818 Frankenstein has also been considered an artificial being, for instance by the science fiction author Brian Aldiss. Beings with at least some appearance of intelligence were imagined, too, in classical antiquity.\\n\\n\\n== Utopian and dystopian visions ==\\nArtificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.\\nIt is a recurrent theme in science fiction; scholars have divided it into utopian, emphasising the potential benefits, and dystopian, emphasising the dangers.\\n\\n\\n=== Utopian ===\\nOptimistic visions of the future of artificial intelligence are possible in science fiction. Benign AI characters include Robby in Lost in Space, from 1965 to 1968; Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation from 1987 to 1994; and Pixar\\'s WALL-E in 2008. Iain Banks\\'s Culture series of novels portrays a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoids, aliens, and advanced beings with artificial intelligence living in socialist habitats across the Milky Way. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have identified four major themes in utopian scenarios featuring AI: immortality, or indefinite lifespans; ease, or freedom from the need to work; gratification, or pleasure and entertainment provided by machines; and dominance, the power to protect oneself or rule over others.Alexander Wiegel contrasts the role of AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey and in Duncan Jones\\'s 2009 film Moon. Whereas in 1968, Wiegel argues, the public felt \"technology paranoia\" and the AI computer HAL was portrayed as a \"cold-hearted killer\", by 2009 the public were far more familiar with AI, and the film\\'s GERTY is \"the quiet savior\" who enables the protagonists to succeed, and who sacrifices itself for their safety.\\n\\n\\n=== Dystopian ===\\n\\nThe researcher Duncan Lucas writes (in 2002) that humans are worried about the technology they are constructing, and that as machines started to approach intellect and thought, that concern becomes acute. He calls the early 20th century dystopian view of AI in fiction the \"animated automaton\", naming as examples the 1931 film Frankenstein, the 1927 Metropolis, and the 1920 play R.U.R. A later 20th century approach he names \"heuristic hardware\", giving as instances 2001 a Space Odyssey, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, The Hitch Hiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy, and I, Robot.

       " Document(page_content='In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the mid-1990s. Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel\\'s Checkers Playing Program, led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition. Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning. Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant\\'s PAC learning, Quinlan\\'s ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.Neural networks, a subsymbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt\\'s perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams, and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989. However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: \"Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn\\'t work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.\" Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nA short history of symbolic AI to the present day follows below.

       " Document(page_content='Existential risk from artificial general intelligence is the idea that substantial progress in artificial general intelligence (AGI) could result in human extinction or an irreversible global catastrophe.One argument goes as follows: human beings dominate other species because the human brain possesses distinctive capabilities other animals lack. If AI were to surpass humanity in general intelligence and become superintelligent, then it could become difficult or impossible to control. Just as the fate of the mountain gorilla depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.The plausibility of existential catastrophe due to AI is widely debated, and hinges in part on whether AGI or superintelligence are achievable, the speed at which dangerous capabilities and behaviors emerge, and whether practical scenarios for AI takeovers exist. Concerns about superintelligence have been voiced by leading computer scientists and tech CEOs such as Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Alan Turing, Elon Musk, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In 2022, a survey of AI researchers with a 17% response rate found that the majority of respondents believed there is a 10 percent or greater chance that our inability to control AI will cause an existential catastrophe. In 2023, hundreds of AI experts and other notable figures signed a statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\" Following increased concern over AI risks, government leaders such as United Kingdom prime minister Rishi Sunak and United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for an increased focus on global AI regulation.\\nTwo sources of concern stem from the problems of AI control and alignment: controlling a superintelligent machine or instilling it with human-compatible values may be difficult. Many researchers believe that a superintelligent machine would resist attempts to disable it or change its goals, as that would prevent it from accomplishing its present goals. It would be extremely difficult to align a superintelligence with the full breadth of significant human values and constraints. In contrast, skeptics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun argue that superintelligent machines will have no desire for self-preservation.A third source of concern is that a sudden \"intelligence explosion\" might take an unprepared human race by surprise. Such scenarios consider the possibility that an AI that is more intelligent than its creators might be able to recursively improve itself at an exponentially increasing rate, improving too quickly for its handlers and society at large to control.

       " Document(page_content='In video games, artificial intelligence (AI) is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-playable characters (NPCs) similar to human-like intelligence. Artificial intelligence has been an integral part of video games since their inception in the 1950s. AI in video games is a distinct subfield and differs from academic AI. It serves to improve the game-player experience rather than machine learning or decision making. During the golden age of arcade video games the idea of AI opponents was largely popularized in the form of graduated difficulty levels, distinct movement patterns, and in-game events dependent on the player\\'s input. Modern games often implement existing techniques such as pathfinding and decision trees to guide the actions of NPCs. AI is often used in mechanisms which are not immediately visible to the user, such as data mining and procedural-content generation.In general, game AI does not, as might be thought and sometimes is depicted to be the case, mean a realization of an artificial person corresponding to an NPC in the manner of the Turing test or an artificial general intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe term \"game AI\" is used to refer to a broad set of algorithms that also include techniques from control theory, robotics, computer graphics and computer science in general, and so video game AI may often not constitute \"true AI\" in that such techniques do not necessarily facilitate computer learning or other standard criteria, only constituting \"automated computation\" or a predetermined and limited set of responses to a predetermined and limited set of inputs.Many industries and corporate voices claim that so-called video game AI has come a long way in the sense that it has revolutionized the way humans interact with all forms of technology, although many expert researchers are skeptical of such claims, and particularly of the notion that such technologies fit the definition of \"intelligence\" standardly used in the cognitive sciences. Industry voices make the argument that AI has become more versatile in the way we use all technological devices for more than their intended purpose because the AI allows the technology to operate in multiple ways, allegedly developing their own personalities and carrying out complex instructions of the user.However, people in the field of AI have argued that video game AI is not true intelligence, but an advertising buzzword used to describe computer programs that use simple sorting and matching algorithms to create the illusion of intelligent behavior while bestowing software with a misleading aura of scientific or technological complexity and advancement. Since game AI for NPCs is centered on appearance of intelligence and good gameplay within environment restrictions, its approach is very different from that of traditional AI.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nGame playing was an area of research in AI from its inception. One of the first examples of AI is the computerized game of Nim made in 1951 and published in 1952. Despite being advanced technology in the year it was made, 20 years before Pong, the game took the form of a relatively small box and was able to regularly win games even against highly skilled players of the game. In 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess. These were among the first computer programs ever written. Arthur Samuel\\'s checkers program, developed in the middle 50s and early 60s, eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur. Work on checkers and chess would culminate in the defeat of Garry Kasparov by IBM\\'s Deep Blue computer in 1997. The first video games developed in the 1960s and early 1970s, like Spacewar!, Pong, and Gotcha (1973), were games implemented on discrete logic and strictly based on the competition of two players, without AI.\\nGames that featured a single player mode with', metadata={'title': 'Artificial intelligence in video games', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_video_games'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='A military artificial intelligence arms race is an arms race between two or more states to develop and deploy lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS). Since the mid-2010s, many analysts have noted the emergence of such an arms race between global superpowers for better military AI, driven by increasing geopolitical and military tensions. An AI arms race is sometimes placed in the context of an AI Cold War between the US and China.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nLethal autonomous weapons systems use artificial intelligence to identify and kill human targets without human intervention. LAWS have colloquially been called \"slaughterbots\" or \"killer robots\". Broadly, any competition for superior AI is sometimes framed as an \"arms race\". Advantages in military AI overlap with advantages in other sectors, as countries pursue both economic and military advantages.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn 2014, AI specialist Steve Omohundro warned that \"An autonomous weapons arms race is already taking place\". According to Siemens, worldwide military spending on robotics was US$5.1 billion in 2010 and US$7.5 billion in 2015.China became a top player in artificial intelligence research in the 2010s. According to the Financial Times, in 2016, for the first time, China published more AI papers than the entire European Union. When restricted to number of AI papers in the top 5% of cited papers, China overtook the United States in 2016 but lagged behind the European Union. 23% of the researchers presenting at the 2017 American Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) conference were Chinese. Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Alphabet, has predicted China will be the leading country in AI by 2025.\\n\\n\\n== Risks ==\\nOne risk concerns the AI race itself, whether or not the race is won by any one group. There are strong incentives for development teams to cut corners with regard to the safety of the system, which may result in increased algorithmic bias. This is in part due to the perceived advantage of being the first to develop advanced AI technology. One team appearing to be on the brink of a breakthrough can encourage other teams to take shortcuts, ignore precautions and deploy a system that is less ready. Some argue that using \"race\" terminology at all in this context can exacerbate this effect.Another potential danger of an AI arms race is the possibility of losing control of the AI systems; the risk is compounded in the case of a race to artificial general intelligence, which may present an existential risk.A third risk of an AI arms race is whether or not the race is actually won by one group. The concern is regarding the consolidation of power and technological advantage in the hands of one group. A US government report argued that \"AI-enabled capabilities could be used to threaten  critical infrastructure, amplify disinformation campaigns, and wage war\":1, and that \"global stability and nuclear deterrence could be undermined\".:11\\n\\n\\n== Stances toward military artificial intelligence ==\\n\\n\\n=== Russia ===\\nRussian General Viktor Bondarev, commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, stated that as early as February 2017, Russia was working on AI-guided missiles that could decide to switch targets mid-flight. The Military-Industrial Commission of Russia has approved plans to derive 30 percent of Russia\\'s combat power from remote controlled and AI-enabled robotic platforms by 2030. Reports by state-sponsored Russian media on potential military uses of AI increased in mid-2017. In May 2017, the CEO of Russia\\'s Kronstadt Group, a defense contractor, stated that \"there already exist completely autonomous AI operation systems that provide the means for UAV clusters, when they fulfill missions autonomously, sharing tasks between them, and interact\", and that it is inevitable that \"swarms of drones\" will one day fly over combat zones. Russia has been testing several autonomous and semi-autonomous combat systems, such as Kalashnikov\\'s \"neural net\" combat m', metadata={'title': 'Artificial intelligence arms race', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"In artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), ablation is the removal of a component of an AI system. An ablation study investigates the performance of an AI system by removing certain components to understand the contribution of the component to the overall system.The term is an analogy with biology (removal of components of an organism), and is particularly used in the analysis of artificial neural nets by analogy with ablative brain surgery. Other analogies include other neuroscience biological systems such as Drosophilla central nervous system and the vertebrate brain. \\nAblation studies require that a system exhibit graceful degradation: the system must continue to function even when certain components are missing or degraded. According to some researchers, ablation studies have been deemed a convenient technique in investigating artificial intelligence and its durability to structural damages.Ablation studies damage and/or remove certain components in a controlled setting to investigate all possible outcomes of system failure; this characterizes how each action impacts the system's overall performance and capabilities. The ablation process can be used to test systems that perform tasks such as speech recognition, visual object recognition, and robot control.In recent years dedicated frameworks have been developed for performing ablation studies of deep neural networks, including AutoAblation and ABLATOR.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe term is credited to Allen Newell, one of the founders of artificial intelligence, who used it in his 1974 tutorial on speech recognition, published in Newell (1975). The term is by analogy with ablation in biology. The motivation was that, while individual components are engineered, the contribution of an individual component to the overall system performance is not clear; removing components allows this analysis.Newell compared the human brain to artificial computers. With this in thought, Newell saw both as knowledge systems whereas procedures such as ablation can be performed on both to test certain hypotheses.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nMuntzing\\n\\n\\n== References ==\", metadata={'title': 'Ablation (artificial intelligence)', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ablation_(artificial_intelligence)'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=' 2 Renewable energy is the energy du jour . In his inaugural address President \\nObama promised to “… harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars \\nand run our factories.” In keeping with this theme,  he has allocated substantial \\nsubsidies to renewables while asserting that the Un ited States will obtain a \\nsignificant portion of its energy from renewables w ithin one or two decades. \\nAccording to the Department of Energy 10% of our el ectricity should come from \\nrenewables by 2012 and 25% by 2025, 2 aims supported by the Renewable Portfolio \\nStandards of 28 states requiring between 15 and 20%  of all electricity to be from \\nrenewables by 2020 to 2030. There is even talk of a  Federal RPS, mandating similar \\ngoals at the national level. For those with an hist orical bent, there is a real sense of \\ndéjà vu here: three centuries ago, we used nothing but renewables, with a fully \\nsustainable energy system consisting of wind power (windmills), hydro power \\n(water mills) and biofuels (wood stoves and animal power). Now we are trying to \\nreturn to the past, with the addition of a few new sources such as solar and \\ngeothermal. In the interim our population has incre ased by a factor of ten and \\neconomic activity by several orders of magnitude.  \\nOne might think that these heroic goals would be ba sed on a detailed analysis \\nof the prospects for a rollout of renewable energy,  with a comprehensive literature \\non the economics of renewable energy. Sadly this is  not the case: there is a \\nliterature, and there are some notable contribution s, but nothing remotely in \\nkeeping with the emphasis on renewables in policy c ircles. So this paper is both a \\nreflection on the literature we have and a call for  a literature that we don’t yet have. \\nThe first discussion of renewables in economics was  in the post-73 oil shock \\nera, when we rediscovered Hotelling’s work on resou rce depletion and refined it in \\nvarious ways. We invented the phrase “backstop tech nology,” a technology that \\nwould eventually replace exhaustible resources with  an energy source continuing \\nforever. Partha Dasgupta and I used the idea in our  work extending Hotelling’s \\n                                                        \\n2 http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/energy_and_environ ment  ', metadata={'source': '/home/yoonshi/Desktop/langchain/inventory/w15081.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' 3 analysis (Dasgupta and Heal, 1973), William Nordhau s worked with this idea in his \\nbook on the efficient allocation of energy resource s (Nordhaus 1973), in which he \\ntried to work out the competitive price of oil, and  so did many others – a quick \\nsearch for “backstop technology” on Google Scholar produced 8,540 references. No \\none modeled the backstop explicitly, but it was cle arly not a fossil fuel that we had in \\nmind: it could have been nuclear fusion, or solar o r wind energy. The only economic \\nrole it played was in setting an upper limit to the  price of fossil energy, an endpoint \\nfor the price path of an exhaustible resource.  \\nThe need for renewables, in the sense of energy fro m non-exhaustible \\nsources having no environmental footprint, was also  recognized and featured in the \\nliterature on “spaceship earth.” But again there wa s little discussion of the details of \\nthese energy sources and their characteristics. Ken neth Boulding’s work on The \\nEconomics of the Coming Spaceship Earth  (Boulding 1966) and Ralph D’Arge and \\nKiichiro Kogiku’s paper on Economic Growth and the Environment  (D’Arge and \\nKogiku 1973) both pointed to the need for inexhaust ible low-impact energy sources, \\ngenerally taken to be nuclear fusion, but did not g rapple in any detail with the \\neconomics of such sources.  \\nThe need to act on climate change, coupled with the  realization that there are \\nno silver bullets like nuclear fusion, has forced p olicy makers to grapple with the \\nmerits of alternative energy and consider the conse quences of moving to carbon-\\nfree energy within a few decades. Of course, carbon -free is not the same as \\nrenewable: nuclear is carbon-free, but probably not  what most people have in mind \\nas renewable, and coal with carbon capture and stor age (CCS) is also carbon-free at \\nthe output level, and again not what most environme ntal groups think of as \\nrenewable. It does seem uncontroversial that at lea st one of nuclear, coal with CCS \\nand renewables has to be adopted on a very large sc ale for a sustainable future, and \\nI will argue below that either nuclear or coal with  CCS must be in the mix as well as \\nmany types of renewables, at least for the foreseea ble future.

       " Document(page_content=' 4 Renewables come in many different flavors: they cer tainly include but may \\nnot be limited to hydro, solar (photovoltaic and th ermal), wind, geothermal, tidal, \\nbiofuels, and waste-to-energy processes. I will foc us mainly on those that can be \\nused to generate electricity, or to replace it. Mos t of them have certain economic \\ncharacteristics in common – large fixed costs and l ow or no variable costs, and \\nconsequently average costs that are very dependent on output levels. Solar, wind, \\nhydro, geothermal, tidal and waste-to-energy all re quire substantial up-front capital \\nexpenditures before any energy is generated, but ha ve no fuel costs (all except \\nwaste-to-energy need no fuel, and waste is usually free). Their only ongoing costs \\nare maintenance and operation, plus some energy inp ut in the case of waste-to-\\nenergy. In contrast, fossil fuel power stations hav e significant fuel costs: a large coal-\\nfired power station can use 10,000 tons of coal dai ly, costing between $50 and $100 \\nper ton, so that fuel costs can be between half a m illion and a million dollars daily. \\nIncidentally, burning one ton of coal will produce between 1.5 and 3.5 tons of CO2, \\ndepending on the carbon content of the coal, implyi ng that a big coal power station \\nproduces fifteen to thirty or more thousand tons of  CO2 daily. This gives some \\ninsight into the sensitivity of coal’s competitive position to the price of carbon: a \\nprice in range of $30 per ton CO2 could double the fuel costs of a coal power station. \\nNuclear is close to renewables in its cost structur e: large capital costs and small \\nongoing fuel costs.  \\nThe fact that renewable energy sources are generall y capital intensive and \\nhave no running costs has an interesting implicatio n. If we build a wind (or other \\nrenewable) power station today, we are providing fr ee electricity to its users for the \\nnext forty years: if we build a coal-fired power st ation today, we are meeting the \\ncapital costs but leaving our successors over its f orty year life to meet the large fuel \\ncosts and the external costs associated with its po llution. When we build a \\nrenewable power station we are effectively pre-payi ng for the next forty years of \\nelectricity from it. This has implications for what  kind of financing might be \\nappropriate – in particular it makes long-term debt  financing seem fair.

       " Document(page_content=' 5 There are two questions that policy-makers need ans wered: is renewable \\nenergy more expensive than fossil energy, and can i t be made available on a large \\nenough scale to replace much of our fossil fuels us e? Neither is easy to answer.  \\nYou can see one difficulty in assessing the cost of  renewable energy – the \\naverage cost depends on the scale, and can vary gre atly, and the marginal cost is \\nvery low. Presumably we want to compare average cos ts, and for this we need a \\nsense of scale. The usual cost measure in this busi ness is the levelized cost of \\nelectricity, lcoe. This is defined as the constant price at which electricity would have \\nto be sold for the production facility to break eve n over its lifetime, assuming that it \\noperates at full capacity. This is usually presente d in terms of private costs, but from \\na policy perspective we need the lscoe, the leveliz ed social cost of electricity, with \\nexternal costs included. We clearly have reasons to  think that the external costs of \\nrenewables are less than those of fossil fuels, par ticularly with respect to emissions \\nof greenhouse gases, but data on this is rather thi n.  \\nWhat for example is the social cost of using a foss il fuel? In any comparison of \\nthe costs of renewable and fossil sources of electr icity, this is a key fact. Obviously \\nan important component of the external costs of fos sil fuels is the social cost of the \\ngreenhouse gases emitted. Here we have a vast range  of estimates: we can look at \\nprices on the European Union’s Emission Trading Mar ket, which have varied \\nbetween $13 and $25 a ton of CO2 over the last year  and a half. But the EU system \\nhas many idiosyncrasies and it is not clear that th is should be a definitive estimate \\nof a social cost. Ideally we want a forward-looking  estimate, an estimate of the social \\ncost of a ton of CO2 emitted today over the course of its residence in the \\natmosphere, which could be as long as the next cent ury. Analyses of the costs of \\nclimate change such as the Stern Review (Stern 2006 ) or William Nordhaus’s \\nreports based on his DICE model (Nordhaus 2009) pro vide estimates of the social \\ncosts of CO2 emissions, though there is little agre ement here. Nordhaus has an \\nestimate of the social cost of CO2 emissions that i s about $8 per ton: Stern’s estimate \\nis an order of magnitude greater at $85. There are many reasons for the difference \\nbut a main one is that Nordhaus uses a pure rate of  time preference (utility discount ', metadata={'source': '/home/yoonshi/Desktop/langchain/inventory/w15081.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' 6 rate) of 4% while Stern uses 0.1%: over periods of a century or more this is a \\nmassive difference. Stern also has a more comprehen sive and up-to-date estimate of \\nthe costs of climate change, and allows for uncerta inty and a wide range of possible \\noutcomes along a business as usual scenario. But th e bulk of the difference is in the \\ndiscount rates (see Hope and Newberry 2007). As I h ave said elsewhere (Heal \\n2009), I see Stern as clearly closer to being corre ct in this debate, and take his \\nestimate of the social cost of CO2 as likely to be nearer to a true estimate. But it is \\nclear from this review of the estimates out there t hat we are not going to get an \\nunambiguous value for the social cost of using foss il fuel.  \\nGiven this range of values for the social costs of CO2 emission, a recent study \\nby Jon Strand (Strand 2008) of the IMF is interesti ng: it calculates the prices of CO2 \\nimplied by various policy measures to reduce emissi ons, finding that this is rarely \\nless than several times the Stern value of the soci al cost. Subsidies to biofuels are \\nsome of the worst offenders.  \\nThe costs of greenhouse gases are not the only exte rnal costs of fossil fuel \\nuse: these include other gaseous emissions such as SO2 and various oxides of \\nnitrogen and fine particles, all of which are assoc iated with environmental damage, \\npoor health and early death. The costs of these emi ssions have been studied by \\nresearchers at Resources for the Future in the cont ext of the social costs of gasoline \\nuse, and Parry (2001) and Parry and Small (2005) ar e good sources.

This depends on four parameters – the costs \\nof oil and other fossil fuels (they tend to move to gether), the cost of carbon \\nemissions or equivalently the extent to which exter nal costs are internalized, the \\ncost of capital, and the incentives available to pr oducers of green electricity (another \\ndimension of the internalization of external costs) .

Coal can in principle be close to \\ncarbon-free, so this does not necessarily contradic t the goal of massive reductions in \\nGHGs. In addition to these markets for electricity or for capacity, in states with an \\nRPS there is generally a market in RECs, or renewab le energy certificates. \\nCompliance with the RPS is ensured through these, w hich are tradable certificates \\nproving that 1kWh of electricity has been generated  via a renewable generator. \\nWhere there is an RPS, electricity distributors are  required at the end of a given year \\nto own sufficient credits to show that a specified % of their total annual power \\nproductions is from renewable sources. \\nOne way of thinking about intermittency is to say t hat there is a social cost \\nassociated with the use of an intermittent power so urce: this is the cost of \\nconstructing capacity to replace it when it is not operating, or alternatively the cost \\nof leaving demand unsatisfied at such times.

Costs are high but again the e xpectation is that they will fall.  \\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) is not a form of c lean energy, but a way \\nof making dirty energy cleaner. It’s a way of movin g to “cleaner coal.” Clean coal, \\nof course, is a controversial concept, ardently adv ocated by the coal industry and \\nstigmatized as unreal by environmental groups. 18  The criticisms appear to be \\nfirstly that it is not yet an operational method, a nd secondly that even were it to be \\noperational, clean coal would remain an oxymoron be cause of the environmental \\nimpact of coal production and transportation. There  seems some merit in this \\npoint, but the focus here is on the economics of CC S as a possible route to carbon-\\nfree energy at competitive costs. It’s potential as  a competitor for renewable \\nenergy is so great that any discussion of renewable s has to consider CCS too.  \\nThere are several ways of preventing a coal-fired p ower station from \\nemitting CO2. One is to scrub it out of the exhaust  gases, using a technology very \\nsimilar to that for scrubbing SO2. Exhaust gases pa ss up a scrubber tower down \\nwhich falls water with ammonium carbonate in soluti on. The CO2 reacts with the \\nammonium carbonate to form ammonium bicarbonate, an d is removed from the \\nexhaust gases. The bicarbonate is then heated, when  it turns back to carbonate and \\nreleases the CO2, which is liquefied and stored in a safe place, generally \\nunderground.  \\n                                                        \\n18  For more details see IPCC 2006.

       " Document(page_content=' 22  An alternative is to break the hydrocarbon molecule s in coal into carbon, \\nhydrogen and oxygen before the coal is burned, remo ve the carbon, and burn the \\nhydrogen. The exhaust gas is water vapor, and the c arbon is burned in the oxygen \\nto make CO2 where it is easily captured.  \\nA final option is to remove all nitrogen from the a ir used to burn the coal, \\nso that it is in effect burned in pure oxygen, givi ng an exhaust stream of pure CO2. \\nIn this case the CO2 does not have to be separated out and the entire exhaust \\nstream is liquefied and stored.  \\nAll of these processes are based on well-understood  and widely used \\nchemical reactions and pose no technical difficulti es. Likewise liquefying and \\nstoring the CO2 is straightforward. The only compli cation here is finding \\nsomewhere to store it where it will remain without leaking out for a very long \\ntime, the preferred location being an exhausted oil  or gas field which held gas \\nunder pressure for many millions of years and can p resumably hold CO2 for a \\nsimilar period of time. In many geological formatio ns the CO2 will actually react \\nwith rocks to form solid carbonates, immobilizing i t in perpetuity.

In such a situation, there is an unders tandable reluctance to construct a \\npower plant with CCS, as this would lock in a techn ology that might be obsolete \\nwell within the life of the plant. Retrofitting exi sting plants is more expensive than \\nadding CCS to a new plant, with the added disadvant age that the number of years \\nof output over which one can spread the extra cost is smaller, the older the plant. \\nAir capture is a variant on CCS: rather than extrac ting CO2 from the \\nexhaust gases of a power station, it is taken direc tly out of the atmosphere. If CO2 \\ncan be extracted from the atmosphere at reasonable cost, it doesn’t matter where \\nthis is done, as CO2 mixes globally within a year o f its emission. So it would be \\nreasonable to extract it where it can be stored, i. e. on top of suitable geological \\nformations, avoiding the costs of transporting the gas (see Lackner and Sachs 2005 \\nfor a discussion).

His \\nconclusion is negative: even covering much of the c ountryside and coastline with \\nwind turbines, placing wave energy devices along ma ny hundreds of miles of \\ncoast and covering most south-facing roofs with sol ar panels, and exploiting every \\nhydro opportunity, there would not be sufficient po wer to meet current UK needs. \\nHe suggests three ways of filing the gap: either co al with CCS, or nuclear, or the \\nimport of renewable energy from solar plants in the  Sahara desert by long distance \\ndirect current high tension lines.

What would this cost? I’ll try to answer an easier question: \\nsuppose electricity consumption stays constant from  now to 2025 (actually it will \\ngrow, quite a lot if we move to electric cars), wha t would it cost to replace 25% of \\nour generating capacity by renewables? Here’s a rou gh calculation. Installed \\nelectric capacity is one million megawatts, or one thousand gigawatts, or a \\nterawatt. Wind capacity costs about $2000 per kilow att to install, leaving out costs \\nof connection to the grid. One terawatt is 10 9 kilowatts, so the investment required \\nif we are using wind is 10 9*2*10 3*0.25/0.25 where 10 9*2*10 3 is the cost of \\nreplacing all capacity by wind, we multiply by 0.25  as we are replacing 25% and \\ndivide by the capacity factor of wind, which I am t aking to be 25%. The answer is \\ntwo trillion dollars, almost certainly an underesti mate as we are leaving out the \\ncost of grid connections and using the capital cost  of onshore wind: both offshore \\nwind and solar are more expensive. This is about 15 % of current GDP, and over \\n15 years it is roughly 1% of current GDP annually. In addition to being an \\nunderestimate, it does not address our dependence o n foreign oil for transportation \\nor furnaces. It would reduce fossil-generated elect ricity from about 70% to about \\n45% of the total. 23  How much CO2 would this save? The answer depends o n what \\nthe wind power displaces: if nuclear or hydro, then  there is no saving of CO2, but \\nif it displaces coal, then the saving is about one billion tons of CO2 annually, 24  \\n                                                        \\n23  For data on the composition of electric power stati on fuels see \\nhttp://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/epm_su m.html  \\n24  Here is the calculation.
